### Recent Education in the UK

Relocated to Scotland in September 2022 presented me with the opportunity to enhance my English language skills and update my technical knowledge. Despite my extensive experience with the **1C platform** (which is akin to Java, Python, C#, C/C++, Dynamics, and Salesforce), I have embraced the challenge of mastering new technologies. My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my high completion rates across several courses, where I have honed my skills in:

- **[Tree Full Stack Project](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Node-RESTful-MongoDB-Bootstrap):** In just two weeks, I learned and applied **Node.js, REST API, MongoDB, and Bootstrap** to build a full-stack web application from scratch.

- **[AWS, APIs, and Cybersecurity](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Software%20Security%20Project):** I gained expertise in **Python development, QA MT/AT, TDD/BDD, encryption techniques**, and deploying **LAMP servers**.
- **[Java and Agile Frameworks](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Java/Glasgow%20Clyde%20Runners%20Club):** I specialised in **designing, project management, and manual testing** using Agile methodologies.
- **[HTML, CSS, and Website Creation](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/HTML-CSSR-JS/Abbington-Farm):** I focused on **designing, manual testing, and creating responsive websites**.
