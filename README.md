# Personal Statement
### My name is *Stanislav Starishko*
**and I live in the UK**

As a results-driven professional, recognized for reliability, ambition, and self-motivation, I specialize in researching and modernizing processes, procedures, and workflows. Leveraging collective experience and knowledge, I possess a strong technical foundation and exhibit self-discipline, thriving with minimal supervision. My outgoing nature is complemented by robust administrative and communication skills, coupled with excellent time management abilities to meet tight deadlines. As a resourceful problem solver, I confidently adapt to new situations. **Since April 2023**, I have been academically advancing my skills in ***Python, Java, Agile, Cyber Resilience, and APIs*** in the UK. Currently, I am actively seeking new challenges in the role of a **Software Engineer**

# Briefly about my Experience

With a solid background in IT product implementation and service delivery and a strong grasp of various project management methodologies, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My proficiency spans any **OOP** and **modular programming languages** at a ***foundational level*** but is deeper in [**Java**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Java), [**Python**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Python), [**HTML**, *and* **CSS**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/HTML-CSSR-JS).

# Recent Education in the UK
My relocation to Scotland in September 2022 presented me with the challenge of enhancing my English language skills and updating my technical knowledge. Despite many years of working with the 1C platform, which is really akin to Java, Python, C#, C/C++, Dynamics, and SalesForce I have made significant strides in familiarising myself with Java and Python. My commitment to continuous learning is evidenced by my high completion rates on several short courses, where I have honed my skills in:
- [**AWS, APIs, *and* Cybersecurity**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Software%20Security%20Project): Gained expertise in **Python** development, **QA MT/AT, TDD/BDD, encryption techniques**, deploying **LAMP servers**, and **CISCO Cyber Ops** (**PDA Cyber Resilience *SCQF8***, *ended* **March 2024**)
- [**Java *and* Agile *Frameworks***](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Java/Glasgow%20Clyde%20Runners%20Club): Specialised in **designing, project management**, *and* **manual testing** (**PDA Software Development *SCQF7***, *ended* **November 2023**)
- **Python, [HTML, CSS](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/HTML-CSSR-JS/Abbington-Farm)**: Focused on **designing, manual testing** *and* **website creation** (**NPA Software Development *SCQF6***, *ended* **July 2023**)
