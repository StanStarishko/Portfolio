# Hey 👋 I'm Stanislav

**Software Engineer** building stuff in Glasgow, Scotland

💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/starishko/)

## Quick Story

Moved from Ukraine to Scotland in 2022 when the war started. Career restart.

Built tons of enterprise software on **1C platform** (similar to Java/Python/.NET ecosystem) - ERP systems, financial platforms, logistics tools. Mostly boring corporate stuff, but paid the bills.

Now retraining in modern tech because honestly, the old stack was getting dull. Currently Year 2 of HND Software Engineering at Glasgow Clyde College.

**How I work:** Use AI tools to code faster - I'm not stupid, why type everything manually? But the architecture, design decisions, and "does this actually make sense?" - that's all me. Think of AI as a junior dev who types really fast but needs supervision.

## What I've Built Recently

### 🤖 [AI-Powered UX Audit Tool](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Risidio-Stage2)
Built this in **6 hours** for a technical assessment (yes, with coffee breaks). Full-stack AI app that analyses websites using GPT-4, generates recommendations, visualises data. Serverless deployment on Vercel.

**Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4, Tailwind CSS

**The challenge:** Show you can prototype fast without sacrificing quality. Delivered production-ready code with proper error handling, responsive design, and decent documentation.

---

### 🛒 [E-Commerce Backend API](https://github.com/StanStarishko/BackForCatalog)
Production-ready RESTful backend with OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, rate limiting, comprehensive tests. Because building secure auth properly is important.

**Tech:** Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript, OAuth 2.0, JWT

**What's good about it:** Proper authentication flow, not the "store password in localStorage" nonsense. Serverless deployment, actual tests, sensible error handling.

---

### 🌐 [Full-Stack Web Applications Trilogy](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Node-RESTful-MongoDB-Bootstrap)
Three projects: car rental system, course management, product catalogue. 

Learned Node.js ecosystem and delivered **3 working apps in 2 weeks** (course timeline said 3 months - I got impatient).

**Tech:** Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Bootstrap

**What I learned:** Async JavaScript doesn't bite if you understand it. MongoDB is fine until you need complex queries. Bootstrap makes things look decent fast.

---

### 📊 [Medical Data Analysis Tool](https://github.com/StanStarishko/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Heart%20Attack%20Risk%20Factors)
Heart attack risk analysis with patient data processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation.

**Tech:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Takeaway:** Data science is 80% cleaning data, 15% trying to make sense of it, 5% making pretty charts.

---

## Tech I Actually Use

**Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**Backend:** Node.js, Next.js, Express, FastAPI, Flask  
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL  
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3, API Gateway), Vercel  
**Tools:** Git, REST APIs, OAuth 2.0, JWT, AI coding assistants

## Currently Learning

**Actively using:** CI/CD pipelines, advanced React patterns  
**Improving:** Microservices architecture (used it before, now modernising approach)  
**Want to learn:** Kubernetes, Spring Boot

Also trying to understand why JavaScript has 47 different ways to handle async operations.

## What I'm Looking For

Software Engineer roles where:
- Fast learning matters more than having 5 years in the exact tech stack
- Problem-solving is valued
- People actually review code and care about quality
- Junior/mid-level positions, apprenticeships, or graduate schemes

Not interested in:
- "Rock star ninja guru" job descriptions
- Places that think 60-hour weeks are normal
- Companies allergic to modern development practices
