# Recent Education in the UK
My relocation to Scotland in September 2022 presented me with the challenge of enhancing my English language skills and updating my technical knowledge. Despite many years of working with the 1C platform, which is really akin to Java, Python, C#, C/C++, Dynamics, and SalesForce I have made significant strides in familiarising myself with Java and Python. My commitment to continuous learning is evidenced by my high completion rates of several short courses, where I have honed my skills in:
- AWS, APIs, and Cybersecurity: Gained expertise in Python development, QA MT/AT, TDD/BDD, encryption techniques, deploying LAMP servers, and CISCO Cyber Ops (PDA Cyber Resilience SCQF8, ended March 2024)
- Java and Agile Frameworks: Specialised in designing, project management, and manual testing (PDA Software Development SCQF7, ended November 2023)
- Python, HTML, CSS: Focused on designing, manual testing and website creation (NPA Software Development SCQF6, ended July 2023
