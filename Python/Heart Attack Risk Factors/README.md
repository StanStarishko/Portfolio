*  **heart_attack_dataset.csv** - data frame


This project was completed in **August 2024**
Time spent on project completion: **2 days** and a total of about **6 hours**

It was completed in **Python** and demonstrates interaction with: 
*  **Work with Data by Python**
*  **Data Analytics** 
*  **Analytics Visualisation**

and the use of 
- [**4 weeks of practice**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/python-programming-for-data/tree/main/Worksheets) using Python and R for data analysis
- [**including a mini-project**](https://github.com/StanStarishko/python-programming-for-data/blob/main/Worksheets/10_2_Movies_Project.ipynb) that served as a prototype core for the final project, which allowed it to be completed rapidly
